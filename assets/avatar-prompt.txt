Logo design for a code utility. Several thin, parallel lines of colored light flow from the left side and elegantly weave or braid together into a single, solid, thicker line on the right. The concept is "merging and simplifying complexity". Use a flat 2D vector style, with vibrant tech colors like blue, purple, and green on a dark black background. Clean, modern, and symbolic.
