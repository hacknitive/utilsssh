logo for an SSH connection utility, symbolizing a robust and persistent connection. The central element is a stylized terminal or command prompt icon. A glowing, unbreakable chain or a resilient energy shield forms a protective circle around the terminal icon, representing a stable, secure, and auto-reconnecting link. The design must be a flat 2D vector graphic. Use a modern tech color palette, such as electric blue, cyan, and a hint of green, set against a dark, professional background. The overall aesthetic should be clean, modern, and symbolic of reliability and automation.
